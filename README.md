# Purpose - Testing Ground

The main purpose of this repository is to act as a sort of testing ground where I can store programs I create while I continue to learn C++. There's not much to see here.


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm currently studying computer science at my local community college. My goal is to teach myself C++ primarily following the guide over at [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/), and then land an internship to gain experience. I have no idea what I'm doing but I'll get there!
